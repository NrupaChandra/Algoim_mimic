This folder contains two Python scripts that together perform a convergence study for machine-learning-based cut-cell area integration. The scripts must be executed in order.

**Scalling\_convergence\_data\_v2.py**

This script generates the exact geometric input data for the convergence study. A fixed implicit interface φ(x, y), defined as a polynomial, is evaluated over the square domain \[-1, 1]².  The domain is uniformly subdivided into n × n subcells for refinement levels n = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.

Each subcell is classified as inside, outside, or partial based on the sign of φ at corners and probe points. For partial subcells, the global polynomial is re-expanded into a local polynomial representation centered on the subcell. This local representation encodes the interface geometry in reference coordinates and is later used as input to the neural network.


Two text files are written. One file contains the locally expanded polynomials for all partial subcells. The second file contains a complete classification summary for all subcells and refinement levels, including unique cell identifiers and per-level counts. No machine learning is used in this script; all geometry handling is exact.


**Scalling\_convergence\_study\_v2.py**

This script performs ML-based area integration using the data generated by the first script. A pre-trained feed-forward neural network is loaded and evaluated on each partial subcell. The network takes the local polynomial description of the interface as input and predicts scaling factors for a fixed tensor-product Gauss quadrature rule on the reference square \[-1, 1]².
The weights are rescaled. The sum of the scaled weights is interpreted as the area fraction of the cut subcell in reference coordinates (this cell also termed as "partial"). Physical subcell areas are obtained by dividing by n².

Inside subcells will contribute their exact area, outside subcells will contribute zero, and partial subcells contribute the ML-predicted area which is computed as mentioned above. All contributions are summed to obtain the total integrated area for each refinement level. An exact reference area is computed analytically using high-precision integration (this is termed as true area). 

Relative errors are evaluated for each refinement level, and a log–log convergence plot of relative error versus element size h = 2 / n is generated. An empirical convergence rate is estimated from the slope.
